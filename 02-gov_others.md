        * IHPC [Complex Systems](http://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/cxsy).
* Urban Redevelopment Authority, MND
    * Small group of software engineers working with other MND agencies
        * DP Lab, Information Systems departments.
    * Established a data exchange and visualisation platform **ePlanner**, designed as data layers overlaid on top of an interactive map[^1].
* NUS Smart Nation research cluster
    * To involve >50 researchers working on gathering big data, optimising results, and cybersecurity.

## Political partners (non-technical)

* [Smart Nation Programme Office](http://www.pmo.gov.sg/smartnation), Prime Minister's Office
    * Established [Nov 2014](https://www.ida.gov.sg/About-Us/Newsroom/Speeches/2014/Transcript-of-prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-speech-at-smart-nation-launch-on-24-november).

[^4]: > “It’s a whole of government effort, and that’s why [the SNPO is] parked under the Prime Minister’s Office”. The office is “a very small outfit: our job is to engage, communicate, coordinate, match, push all the actors on to the stage.”
    [...] Its position within the Prime Minister’s Office is vital for getting this quick action: some decisions involve trade-offs between agencies, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has set out this vision as a priority for Singapore over the next decade. The SNPO exists to “crystallise the issue, bump it upstairs, get the Prime Minister to decide one way or the other. The point is not to be held up by bureaucratic inertia or infighting.” -- [OpenGov's interview with Smart Nation Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, 18 May 2015](http://www.opengovasia.com/articles/6488-exclusive-interview-singapores-smart-nation-minister)

## Relationship between Smart Nation partners

* [CSA](https://www.csa.gov.sg/) has national oversight of cybersecurity including both the public and private sector, with GTO responsible for rule enforcement in the public sector.[^3]
* SNPO will coordinate Smart Nation initiatives, but all the engineering work and related implementation will be done by GTO.[^3]

[^3]: > Channel NewsAsia understands that there will be no overlaps between the two new bodies with related agencies such as the Smart Nation Programme Office (SNPO) and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA).
    For instance, in the area of cybersecurity, CSA has national oversight and is working with respective sectors’ regulators to strengthen their IT security. For Government ICT initiatives, it will work with GTO in the area of cybersecurity, but the latter will be in charge of enforcing regulations in the public sector.
    SNPO, which is under the Prime Minister’s Office, remains the coordinating body in the public sector where Smart Nation initiatives are concerned. However GTO, not SNPO, will be the agency that implements Smart Nation's core infrastructure, Channel NewsAsia understands. -- [IDA, MDA to be restructured to capitalise on converging media and ICT landscape, ChannelNewsAsia, 18 Jan 2016.](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ida-mda-to-be/2433768.html)
