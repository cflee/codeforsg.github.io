## Efforts by incumbent organisations

* I2R and IHPC, A*STAR
    * [I2R](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/) and [IHPC](http://www.ihpc.a-star.edu.sg/) are the national R&D labs for computer science and high performance computing respectively. They are primarily focused on research but have devoted resources to support the Smart Nation initiative.
    * [I2R's Smart Nation masterplans](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/sites/default/files/online-kit/FINAL%20Astar%20Smart%20Nation_single%20page.pdf).
    * Initiatives include the [Urban Systems Initiative](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/urban/):
        * I2R's data platform [A\*STAR Data Analytics Exchange (A\*DAX)](/download/A*DAX brochure.pdf) ([paper](/download/A*DAX paper.pdf)).
        * IHPC [Complex Systems](http://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/cxsy).
* Urban Redevelopment Authority, MND
    * Small group of software engineers working with other MND agencies
        * DP Lab, Information Systems departments.
    * Established a data exchange and visualisation platform **ePlanner**, designed as data layers overlaid on top of an interactive map[^1].
* NUS Smart Nation research cluster
    * To involve >50 researchers working on gathering big data, optimising results, and cybersecurity.

## Defence

* Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies, MINDEF
    * Group of software engineers.
* DSO National Laboratories, MINDEF
    * Group of defence science researchers, including machine learning practitioners.

## Political partners (non-technical)

* [Smart Nation Program Office](http://www.pmo.gov.sg/smartnation), Prime Minister's Office
    * Provides **political support** to break down interagency barriers and coordinates initiatives under a common 'Smart Nation'[^2] banner.
    * **Politicians**: PM Lee Hsien Loong, Smart Nation Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Janil Puthucheary
    * [Civil servants](http://app.sgdi.gov.sg/listing.asp?agency_subtype=dept&agency_id=0000026757): Tan Kok Yam

## Relationship between Smart Nation partners

* [CSA](https://www.csa.gov.sg/) has national oversight of cybersecurity including both the public and private sector, with GTO responsible for rule enforcement in the public sector.[^3]
* SNPO will coordinate Smart Nation initiatives, but all the engineering work and related implementation will be done by GTO.[^3]

> Channel NewsAsia understands that there will be no overlaps between the two new bodies with related agencies such as the Smart Nation Programme Office (SNPO) and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA).
For instance, in the area of cybersecurity, CSA has national oversight and is working with respective sectors’ regulators to strengthen their IT security. For Government ICT initiatives, it will work with GTO in the area of cybersecurity, but the latter will be in charge of enforcing regulations in the public sector.
SNPO, which is under the Prime Minister’s Office, remains the coordinating body in the public sector where Smart Nation initiatives are concerned. However GTO, not SNPO, will be the agency that implements Smart Nation's core infrastructure, Channel NewsAsia understands.
