* Views on outsourcing and contracting out software development. The need for inhouse expertise.
    * Avoiding getting overcharged by contractors and taken for a ride
        * Divergence in motivations, with contractors maximising profit and inhouse engineers optimising for service and 'doing the right thing'
        * Inhouse engineers are incentivised to invest in infrastructure and maintainable code that will save them work in the long run. Software is built with an eye for the long term, rather than for the purpose of hitting a contract deadline or generating a press release.
    * View contractors as a force multiplier, rather than providing expertise not available inhouse.
        * Inhouse software engineers should be technically capable of implementing it themselves if needed to or given adequate time.
        * This avoids the situation where there is no inhouse expertise to assess the quality of the product delivered.
        * This aims to avoid the common practice where a contractor submits a low-priced bid, wins the tender, and produces a sub-par product that barely meets specifications and fails in the fundamental goal. The contractor then makes further money by making it expensive to submit change requests, claiming that they are beyond the original specification. Even if the government wishes to LD the contractor into insolvency, the public still ends up with a poorly-implemented, unmaintainable and unextensible mess of spaghetti code which quickly breaks down and needs to be replaced prematurely, starting the procurement process again.
        * Lack of sufficient testing results in D-day production nightmares.
    * Acceptance testing should be implemented at the code level with an inhouse software engineer reviewing the code as it is written, instead of making it outcome-based when the product has already been completed and only minor modifications are possible.
        * The contractor's process and progress should be continuously assessed, and problems caught right when they are introduced into the codebase when they can be fixed.
    * Long procurement cycles are hard to reconcile with an iterative and agile model of software development.
    * MOE ESTL
    * iDA GDS
* Smart Nation
    * The successor to iN2015, Smart Nation describes a better Singapore made possible through greater access to data, greater citizen participation in government and a government that leverages technology capabilities to better serve citizens.
    * It is a major impetus driving the need for inhouse software engineering expertise in order to best leverage opportunities made possible through the application of computer science.
    * It is coordinated by SNPO, PMO and supported by iDA, A\*STAR and other agencies.
