This is an **independent** site. It aims to:

* pool factual information about recent efforts to develop inhouse software engineering expertise in the Singapore government.
* link up people in government working towards similar goals.
* help recruitment by increasing public awareness of these initiatives.

This is about software engineers helping to design, engineer and implement solutions to Singaporean problems. It is **not** about corporate IT or off-the-shelf solutions. It is **not** about Singapore startups or industry, as interesting as they may be.

It is not affiliated with any organisation, including those mentioned in the site. Almost all information here is sourced from publicly available resources and news articles. All opinions expressed are the views of the individual contributors.

This website is open-source and is backed by a GitHub repository. Feel free to submit a pull request ([how?](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)) to add more information! Or [open an issue]({{site.github.repository_url}}/issues).
